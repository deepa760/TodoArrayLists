# Todo project illustrates about the tasks assigned to a person which consists of the below lists.
The application will allow a user to
create new tasks, assign them a title and due date, and choose a project for that
task to belong to. They will need to use a text based user interface via the
command-line.
Once
they are using the application, the user should be able to also edit, mark as done or
remove tasks. They can also quit and save the current task list to file, and then
restart the application with the former state restored.

Requirements
The solution must achieve the following requirements:
‣ Model a task with a task title, due date, status and project
‣ Display a collection of tasks that can be sorted both by date and project
‣ Support the ability to add, edit, mark as done, and remove tasks
‣ Support a text-based user interface
‣ Load and save task list to file.
