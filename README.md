# Todo project illustrates about the tasks assigned to a person which consists of the below lists.
The application will allow a user to
create new tasks, assign them a title and due date, and choose a project for that
task to belong to. They will need to use a text based user interface via the
command-line.

remove tasks. They can also quit and save the current task list to file, and then
restart the application with the former state restored.
